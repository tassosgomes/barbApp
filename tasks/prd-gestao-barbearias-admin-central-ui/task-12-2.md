# Task 12.2: Performance Optimization

**Status**: ðŸ”µ Not Started | **Priority**: MÃ©dia | **Effort**: 0.25 day | **Phase**: 12 - Refinement (PARALLELIZABLE)

## Description
Optimize application performance including lazy loading, debouncing, memoization, and bundle size reduction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lazy loading for routes implemented
- [ ] Search input debounced (300ms)
- [ ] Memoization applied where needed (React.memo, useMemo)
- [ ] Bundle size <500KB initial load
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score >90
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Webpack bundle analyzer report

## Dependencies
**Blocking**: All component and page tasks
**Blocked**: None (can parallelize with 12.1, 12.3)

## Implementation Notes
Use React.lazy, React.memo, useMemo, useCallback strategically.

## Reference
- **Tech Spec**: 11.3 Checklist (Performance section)
- **PRD**: Performance requirements

## Next Steps
Can parallelize with Tasks 12.1, 12.3
