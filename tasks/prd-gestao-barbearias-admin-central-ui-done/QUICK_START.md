# Quick Start Guide - Admin Central UI Implementation

## Overview

This guide helps you start implementing the Admin Central UI for barbershop management following the approved 20-task structure.

## File Structure

```
tasks/prd-gestao-barbearias-admin-central-ui/
├── prd.md                      # Product Requirements Document
├── techspec.md                 # Technical Specification
├── tasks-summary.md            # Master task overview (READ THIS FIRST)
├── QUICK_START.md             # This file
└── task-*.md                   # 20 individual task files
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Review Documentation (15 minutes)

1. **Read tasks-summary.md** - Understand the overall structure, timeline, and dependencies
2. **Skim prd.md** - Understand user requirements and business goals
3. **Reference techspec.md** - Technical implementation details (use as reference during development)

### 2. Choose Your Approach

#### Solo Developer
Follow tasks sequentially:
- Days 1-2: Tasks 1.1-1.2 (Foundation)
- Days 2-4: Tasks 2.1-2.3 (Types & API)
- Days 4-6: Tasks 3.1-3.3 (Authentication)
- Days 6-7: Tasks 4.1-4.2 (Routing)
- Days 7-8: Tasks 5.1-5.4 (Components)
- Days 9-14: Tasks 6.1-9.1 (CRUD pages, one at a time)
- Day 15: Task 10.1 (Additional features)
- Days 16-18: Tasks 11.1-11.4 (Testing)
- Day 19: Tasks 12.1-12.3 (Refinement)

**Total**: ~15 days

#### Team of 4
**Days 1-7**: Team works together on foundation (Tasks 1-5)

**Days 8-10**: Split into parallel lanes
- Developer 1: Task 6.1 (List Page)
- Developer 2: Task 7.1 (Create Page)
- Developer 3: Task 8.1 (Edit Page)
- Developer 4: Task 9.1 (Details Page)

**Days 11-13**: Rejoin for testing
- All: Tasks 10.1, 11.1-11.4

**Day 14**: Parallel refinement
- Dev 1: Task 12.1 (Accessibility)
- Dev 2: Task 12.2 (Performance)
- Dev 3: Task 12.3 (Documentation)
- Dev 4: Final integration testing

**Total**: ~13 days

### 3. Start Implementation

#### Open First Task
```bash
cd /home/tsgomes/github-tassosgomes/barbApp/tasks/prd-gestao-barbearias-admin-central-ui
cat task-1-1.md
```

#### Task File Structure
Each task file contains:
- **Status** - Current state (🔵 Not Started, 🟡 In Progress, 🟢 Complete)
- **Description** - What needs to be built
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Definition of done (checklist)
- **Dependencies** - What must be done first
- **Implementation Notes** - Code examples and guidance from tech spec
- **Testing Requirements** - How to verify it works
- **Files to Create/Modify** - Concrete file paths
- **Verification Checklist** - Final quality checks
- **Reference** - Links to relevant sections in PRD/Tech Spec
- **Next Steps** - What task comes next

#### Update Task Status
As you work, update the status in the task file:
```markdown
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress  # When you start
**Status**: 🟢 Complete     # When all acceptance criteria met
```

### 4. Follow the Critical Path

#### Phase 1-5: Foundation (CRITICAL - Cannot Parallelize)
These MUST be done sequentially. Don't skip or rush.

```
Task 1.1 → Task 1.2 → Task 2.1 → Task 2.2 → Task 2.3 →
Task 3.1 → Task 3.2 → Task 3.3 → Task 4.1 → Task 4.2 →
Tasks 5.1-5.4
```

**Why**: Each task builds on the previous. Skipping will cause problems.

#### Phase 6-9: CRUD Pages (Can Parallelize)
After Phase 5 completes, these can run in parallel if you have multiple developers.

```
Task 6.1 (List)   ┐
Task 7.1 (Create) ├─ Can work simultaneously
Task 8.1 (Edit)   ├─ Share: Types, API service, Components
Task 9.1 (Details)┘
```

**Solo**: Do one at a time (order: 6.1 → 7.1 → 8.1 → 9.1)
**Team**: Split tasks among developers

#### Phase 10-12: Features, Testing, Polish
```
Task 10.1 → Tasks 11.1-11.4 → Tasks 12.1-12.3 (can parallelize)
```

## Task Tracking

### Mark Tasks Complete
Update task status in the file header when complete:

```markdown
**Status**: 🟢 Complete
```

### Track Progress
Keep a simple log:

```
Day 1: ✅ Task 1.1 Complete - Project setup done
Day 2: ✅ Task 1.2 Complete - Folder structure created
       🟡 Task 2.1 In Progress - Defining types
```

### Blockers
If stuck, reference:
1. **Implementation Notes** in task file
2. **Tech Spec** section referenced in task
3. **PRD** for business context
4. Previous similar tasks for patterns

## Quality Gates

### Phase Exit Criteria

Before moving to next phase, verify:

**Phase 1**: ✅ `npm run dev` works, folder structure created
**Phase 2**: ✅ All types compile, schemas validate, API service methods exist
**Phase 3**: ✅ Can login and access protected routes
**Phase 4**: ✅ All routes accessible, navigation works
**Phase 5**: ✅ All reusable components render without errors
**Phases 6-9**: ✅ Each CRUD page fully functional with validation
**Phase 10**: ✅ Deactivate/reactivate flow works with confirmations
**Phase 11**: ✅ >70% test coverage, all tests passing
**Phase 12**: ✅ WCAG AA compliant, bundle <500KB, README complete

## Common Patterns

### Task Execution Pattern
1. Read entire task file
2. Check dependencies are complete
3. Review implementation notes and code examples
4. Create/modify files listed
5. Run tests
6. Verify acceptance criteria
7. Complete verification checklist
8. Update task status to 🟢 Complete
9. Commit changes
10. Move to next task

### Git Commit Pattern
Commit after each task completion:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement login page with validation

- Create Login component with react-hook-form
- Add Zod validation schema
- Integrate with auth API endpoint
- Add loading and error states
- Complete Task 3.1

```

### Testing Pattern
- Unit tests: Write alongside component implementation
- Integration tests: Write after service layer complete
- E2E tests: Write after all CRUD pages complete

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm stuck on a task"
1. Re-read **Implementation Notes** section
2. Check **Reference** section for tech spec details
3. Look at similar completed tasks for patterns
4. Verify **Dependencies** are actually complete
5. Check backend API is running and responding

### "Tests are failing"
1. Read error message carefully
2. Check test examples in tech spec
3. Verify mock data matches real API responses
4. Ensure MSW handlers configured correctly

### "Task acceptance criteria unclear"
1. Reference PRD section for business context
2. Reference tech spec section for technical details
3. Look at implementation notes for code examples

## Success Criteria

You'll know you're done when:

- ✅ All 20 tasks marked 🟢 Complete
- ✅ All acceptance criteria in each task met
- ✅ `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
- ✅ `npm test` shows >70% coverage, all tests passing
- ✅ `npm run test:e2e` - All E2E scenarios passing
- ✅ Login → Create → Edit → Deactivate → Reactivate flow works end-to-end
- ✅ README.md complete with setup instructions
- ✅ No console errors in production build

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't skip foundation tasks** - They're critical for everything else
2. **Test as you go** - Don't save all testing for Phase 11
3. **Commit frequently** - After each task or sub-task
4. **Follow the patterns** - Use code examples from tech spec
5. **Verify acceptance criteria** - Don't skip the verification checklist
6. **Ask for help early** - Don't spend hours stuck on one issue
7. **Keep PRD/Tech Spec open** - Reference constantly
8. **Run the app frequently** - Catch issues early

## Ready to Start?

```bash
# 1. Open master summary
cat tasks-summary.md

# 2. Open first task
cat task-1-1.md

# 3. Begin implementation!
```

Good luck! 🚀
